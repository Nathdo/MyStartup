## Project Overview

This project is a **YouTube comments analyzer** powered by **LLMs**.  
It extracts comments from a given YouTube video and analyzes them using **OpenAI GPT-3.5** to generate:

- A sentiment summary (positive, neutral, negative)
- Key insights and feedback for the video creator
- An overview of viewersâ€™ emotions and topics

> This is a fully working **demo** project, deployed to production with **Flask** and **Railway**.

## Why This Project?

YouTube creators receive thousands of comments, making it hard to:
- Understand what their audience really thinks
- Identify recurring feedback
- Spot ideas for future content

This tool provides creators with **quick insights** about their community.
